   - Explain feature-based stereotyping! Can you think of an example of the same process at work here in Norway?
     (Hjemme på Hen)

   - bias, forklar biaser		bias/bie
   - kroppslige trekk/ansiktstrekk	trekk/star trekMODUL 1
   - Studie av dommer i USA
   - mer afrikanske trekk = kraftigere dom 	sterkt afroamerikansk, sterk dom
   - Dess mer stereotypiske svarte trekk, dess sannere er stereotypen. Finnes ikke I mellom gruppene, men 
     kun innenfor gruppene (svarte med sterkere trekk, bedømmet mer stereotypisk enn andre svarte. 
     Samme med hvite med svarte trekk)likner stereotype = bedømmet som mer riktig/sterk afroamerikansk
   - biasen skjer unconcious no control/no konto bie
   - Årsak til hvorfor:
   - skjemaer		skjemaer//skjermer
   - Diskusjon hva som hadde skjedd med samme I Norge
   - USA lang erfaring med afroamerikanere, og afrikanske
   - ikke lenger forskjell på dom for svarte og hvite, diskutere også hvorvidt feature-based stereotyping kan bli borte ved å sette fokus på dette hos dommerne.		Focus/fokusering
   - interresant å tenke på om det er noen bias FØR man kommer inn I rettssystemet	bias  FØR/bie

** DONE Question 2
   - What can we assess with the who-said-what paradigm and how can this be achieved?
     Why is categorization by sex automatic, but categorization by race not, according to evolutionary
     psychology?
     (Kringsjå)
     
** DONE Question 3
   - What is the shooter bias and how is it measured?
   If we were to assess the shooter bias against Non-Caucasians wearing Muslim headgear what result
   would you expect? Explain!

** TODO Question 4
   * What is anticipatory reciprocity? How does it emerge?
     
** DONE Question 5
   - How convincing is the evidence for Botox reducing emotion recognition accuracy? (to answer this
   question, you should also do a search for other studies on the same issue!
   (Forskningsparken)

** DONE Question 6
   - Why do people react with elevated cortisol to not being mimicked?
   What is socially dependent cortisol reactivity?
   What implications might the present findings have for health models and health interventions?
   (Bestemor/bestefar på Storløkka)

** DONE Question 7
   - When do people tend to mimic each other behaviorally? Explain what sorts of behavior can be mimicked!
   Should we train people to mimic?

*** Stikkord

    1. Behavioural mimicry: when two or more people engage in the same behaviour at the same time
       - Verified by that people do the same, or similar act at a certain time, typically no longer than 3 to 5 seconds after
    2. Mannerisms, gestures, postures, and other motor movements can all be mimicked
    3. When do people tend to mimic each other?
       1) Pre-existing rapport
	  - Mimic a friend more than a stranger
	  - mimic likeable confederates more than less likeable
	    - done research where person was presented as either open and honest, or closed and dishonest
	  - Mimic ingroup more than outgroup
	    - even with such an arbitrary cue as sharing similar first names
       2) With a goal to affiliate with someone
	  - people were primed with a goal to affiliate (either consciously or unconciously)
	  - consciously: was told it was beneficial for the experiment if they got along with the confederate
	  - unconsciously: primed with words like affiliate, friend and together before interacting with the confederate
	  - no difference between conscious and unconscious
       3) Inidividual differences in prosocial orientation
	  - People that are more prosocial, and more interdependent on society, show higher mimicry
	    - This both when being primed, and when comparing cultures (Japan vs USA), regardless of race
       4) Similiarity
	  - Mimics with similar opinions to their own (can be explain by in and outgroup as well)
	  - Another forms of similarity: shared knowledge, stereotypes can be conceptualised as one form of shared knowledge
       5) Mood and emotion
	  - Tend to mimic others more when we are happy (done by priming people to be happe or sad)
	  - Interestingly there's one sad emotion that induces more mimicry. Guilt.
	    - participant bumped into by a confederate, conferederate either takes responsibility, or blames the participant
	    - Afterwards mimic a video more when they were blamed, and could not make amends with the confederate(he/she left immediately)
    4. When do people NOT mimic each other (inhibitors)
       - goal to disaffiliate
    5. Consequences of mimicry
       1) cognitive processing
	  - people that are being mimicked tend to become more field dependent
	  - Mimicked people also tend to be more conformative to their own stereotypes (women and african-american men did worse on maths test after being mimicked)
	  - Mimicking increases persuasion and consumer behaviour
	  - LINKE DET TIL EMBODIMENT (feeling of cold when being mimicked more or less than expected (something is "off", and social coldness)

   - How does havinga negative attitude towards someone influence facial responses to facial emotional
   expressions of that person? (Bestemor/bestefar på andre sia)
   
* DONE Module 2
  
* TODO Module 3
** TODO Question 1
   - What does it mean to say that a social concept is embodied? 
   Compare the idea of modal mental representations to the idea of amodal mental representations in associative networks. 
   Illustrate this with an example.
*** Stikkord
    - embodied cognition/grounded cognition
      - Everything is grounded in the sensory
    - modal vs amodal representations
    - amodal representations
      - Traditional: amodal system in a module based system
      - computer
      - body and mind divided
      - Explain embodiment features as embodiments effects where these effect are simply linked to the
      - Associative networks
	- Everything bound together by abstract symbols torn away from the external world
	- Explains a lot of stuff concerning retrieval of memory etc. very well
	- Some things associative cannot explain, however
	  - Say whether a sentence makes sense or not by pulling a lever towards yourself, or pushing it from yourself
	  - People made to move in a portly way, reports other people as having more traits of an overweight person
    - Embodied cognition
      - one system
      - grounded in our sensory and motoric behaviour
      - Barsaoulu
	- when we think of something we reactivate the places used to experience in the first place
	- Torskerogn
    
** DONE Question 2
   - How could modal representations develop? Describe at least 2 different accounts, and name examples of embodied concepts for each
*** DONE Stikkord
    1) Grounded cognition
       - mental representations are all grounded in bodily morphology
       - All aspects of psychological processes are influenced by some degree by our real life world
    2) Explain modal representations
       - We can say that the embodiment framework assumes how we analyze and react to a situation must take into account our bodily abilities.
       - They remain in your head as physical, and no matter what, you can relate this to the real world vs associative network 
    3) Direct experience: development of schemas where we connect something new to 
       already existing modal representations. Butterfly: an insect, small, flys, etc.
       - Eple erfaring
       - Judgement (example of how direct experiences are used to connect it to something
	 completely abstract, and develop a modal representation of it)
    4) metaphoric mapping: developed by having no direct experience or anything to link an abstract concept
       up against. Therefore we use linguistic metaphors to explain something completely abstract
       - Use example of time mapped into our spatial dimensions
       - Also use smell example, Lee and Schwarz found that smell influences suspicion
    5) inherited association: got no fucking clue (yet), considering to just leave it out, and explain metaphoric and direct

** TODO Question 3
*** Stikkord
    - Explain what hindsight bias is
    - is skewness in our judgements that makes us not being able to be neutral when making judgements and decisions
    - Hindisght bias is divided into three levels
      - Memory distortion(lowest level)
	- When trying to recall what your own predictions were, you simply remember wrong
      - Inevitability (second level)
	- The belief that something simply had to happen
	- subsumes memory distortion and builds on top of that
	- Instead of just distorted memory, it also takes into account a belief in causal forces that make it seem that it had to happen
      - Foreseeability (last level)
	- the belief that you knew it all along
	- subsumes inevitability but also adds on top the assumed ability and prowess of predicting outcomes
    - Have three different levels of cognitive input that in different ways effect the three levels of hindsight bias
      - Cognitive inputs
	- Recollection
	  - might not remember what one earlier said, therefore rely more on the newly acquired information
	  - Might also confuse the sources from where the information came 
	- Knowledge updating
	  - Knowledge updating refers to the integration of new information into existing memory structures
	  - Might leading to hindsight bias by the fact that when getting that last bit of information everything finally fits together
	    and everything simply makes more sense
	  - When integrating new information it will then reactivate the points that actually fit in with this new information
	    making the cues that could predict the outcome more prominent in memory
	- Sensemaking
